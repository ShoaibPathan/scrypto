# scrypto

Trash package to encrypt / decrypt files easily. I made this mainly to play a bit with the swift argument parser.

Using [SwiftArgumentParsrer](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser) cause it's almost required to make a proper CLI
and [BlueRSA](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/BlueRSA) because I have no clue on how this works and I needed something to work with so...

## Things to add

~~Extension check~~ (9953cf8482f6be3f95ba04ae18f2e791608eaeab)

Name randomizer

Mass encrypt/decrypt

Better error handling

Better verbose mode

Tests I guess...
